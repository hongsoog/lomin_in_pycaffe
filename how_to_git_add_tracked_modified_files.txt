Add all modified files in git - the easy way

source: https://coderwall.com/p/gf50uw/add-all-modified-files-in-git-the-easy-way

I recently saw a protip that use git ls-files to add modified files. Like so:
$ git ls-files --modified | xargs git add

You don't have to do that!

All you need to do is:

git add -u
